# Real-time task Scheduler

## Overview
This project implements a simple Round Robin scheduling algorithm for task management in a simulated real-time operating system environment. The scheduler alternates between tasks, executing each for a specified time slice. It is designed to showcase basic scheduling principles and can be extended to include more complex features.

## Features
- Executes tasks in a round-robin manner.
- Notifies when each task is completed.
- Easy to add or modify tasks and their execution times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling the C code.
- A Unix-based terminal (Linux, macOS) for running the commands.
